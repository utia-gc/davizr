`davizr` is an R package that makes it easy to import and visualize data for sequencing data differential analysis such as identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from RNA-seq data, calling differentially accessible regions (DARs) from ATAC-seq data, etc.

## Installation

You can install the development version of davizr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("trev-f/davizr")
```

## Example

A common task in RNA-seq analysis is simply to construct a matrix of read counts within genes from a collection of files generated by `featureCounts`.
